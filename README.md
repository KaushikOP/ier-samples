## Requirements and prerequisites

Perform the following tasks to prepare to deploy your IBM Enterprise Records images on Kubernetes:

- Prepare your IBM Enterprise Records environment. These procedures include setting up storage and configuration files that are required for use and operation. You must complete all of the [preparation steps for IBM Enterprise Records]( https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNVVQ_5.2.1/com.ibm.p8.installingrm.doc/containers/frmin012.htm) before you are ready to deploy the container images. 

- Prepare your Kubernetes environment. See [Preparing for deployment with an operator]( https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSNVVQ_5.2.1/com.ibm.p8.installingrm.doc/containers/frmin012.htm)

This repository includes folders and resources to help you install the IBM Enterprise Records capabilities. Installation of the capabilities is done with the operator.
